Little Boxes
============

Heavily based on the [Boxup Puzzle game](http://www.mathsisfun.com/games/boxup-puzzle.html), little boxes is a puzzle game that, at its heart, is very simple. You are a small being that can push boxes (a box-pushing superhero perhaps) and your goal is to get the red box into the blue box. 

Boxes have between zero and four sides and you can push a box in any direction in which it has a side. You can enter a box (needed in order to push it) via any side in which it does *not* have a side.
